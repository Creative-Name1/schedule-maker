Class name: Schedule
contains a list of events, sorting algorithm, preset methods (will add later), and writes schedule to a text file

I want to make timer run in background, and open window when next event happen




things to add later:
- selection sort when make new schedule, bubble sort when add element to schedule
- ability to change schedule after

maxlistindex = 3
a = 0
b = 0
smallest = 0
