Class name: Schedule
contains a list of events, sorting algorithm, preset methods (will add later), and writes schedule to a text file

I want to make timer run in background, and open window when next event happen


things to add today:
- heavy work preset function

things to add later:
- selection sort when make new schedule, bubble sort when add element to schedule
- ability to change schedule after
- timer will run in background using .bat files

SCHEDULE PRESET PSEUDOCODE:
check collision function for 10 minutes before every *transitional activity*
make a list of all the non-colliding 10-minute breaks as events starting 10 minutes before following events start, with special type
append to schedule
sort
loop:
    use collision function to check for 30 minutes after each activity
    if colliding with 10 minute function: delete the one in question
    make list of all non colliding 30 minute blocks, in form of 25 minute work, 5 minute break
    if list is empty:
        break
    append
    sort
check each item of the list like so:
if the next item starts after the end of the current one, append to a list a break event that spans the time between them
add the contents of the list to the schedule
sort
done!
