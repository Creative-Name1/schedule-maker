Class name: Schedule
contains a list of events, sorting algorithm, preset methods (will add later), and writes schedule to a text file

I want to make timer run in background, and open window when next event happen


things to add today:
- schedule fix event collisions function
- schedule collision function
- heavy work preset function

things to add later:
- selection sort when make new schedule, bubble sort when add element to schedule
- ability to change schedule after
- timer will run in background using .bat files

COLLISION FUNCTION PSEUDOCODE:
make a copy of current list
search nextevent, passing in the current event + 1 second and list copy
if it finds an event that starts at a time less than the ending of the event passed in, add it to a list and remove it from the copy
repeat until it finds something that is more than the ending of the list
then linear search through every event preceding the one passed into it, comparing its end date to the start date of the one passed in
if it's more, append that one to the colliding list
return the list

SCHEDULE FIX EVENT COLLISIONS FUNCTION PSEUDOCODE:
compare every event's end date to the following event's end date
if there's a problem, change the event's end date to the start of the next one's.

SCHEDULE PRESET PSEUDOCODE:
check collision function for 10 minutes before every transitional activity
make a list of all the non-colliding 10-minute breaks as events starting 10 minutes before following events start, with special type
append to schedule
sort
loop:
    use collision function to check for 30 minutes after each activity
    if colliding with 10 minute function: delete the one in question
    make list of all non colliding 30 minute blocks, in form of 25 minute work, 5 minute break
    if list is empty:
        break
    append
    sort
check each item of the list like so:
if the next item starts after the end of the current one, append to a list a break event that spans the time between them
add the contents of the list to the schedule
sort
done!
